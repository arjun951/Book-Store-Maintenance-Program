# Book-Store-Maintenance-Program
Book Store Maintenance Program in C++.
Its's a project to keep a record of all sales, purchases, amounts, history etc in a book store.

## Feateurs are as follows:
1. Add a new book
2. Sell a book
3. Find a book by - title keyword, ISBN digits, Author's name and Month of inclusion.
4. See all books
5. View History (full history) - shows book title, action (sold or added) and time-date-day of action.

## How to use:
1. Copy the code from main.cpp file to any IDE (I use code blocks) you want.
2. In your c++ project file create 2 (.txt) files named - total and total_history .
3. In both the txt file type a zero (0) and save them.
4. Run the code in you IDE and start by registering a new book (other fatures are of no use if you don't have any book).
5. After registering a book you can check all other fatures.
